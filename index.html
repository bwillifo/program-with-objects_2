        <div class="lesson">
             <h2 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-1">
            <h4><u>History and web basics</u></h4>  
            <p>Invented in the early 1990's<br>
            Basics include:  Web, HTML, URL, HTTP, Web Applications <br>
            The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML <b>(Hypertext Markup Language)</b> Documents by which HTML "glues" Documents, Images, videos together
            and <em>Hyperlinks</em> or "links" makes up the web<br></p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-2">
            <h4><u>Major Pieces</u></h4>
            - You, your computer, internet, HTTP and Servers make up the major pieces<br>
            - Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox use HTTP to communicate with the servers.<br>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-3">
            <h4><u>Key Definitions</u></h4>
            - <b>HTTP</b> = Main protocol of the web.<br>
            - <b>Servers</b> = hosts the files that make up the web<br>
            - <b>Internet</b> = Largest computer network<br>
            - <b>Browser</b> = program on your computer to display the files on the web.<br>
            - <b>HTML</b> = <b>(Hypertext Markup Languange)</b> is the heart of the web; takes text content and     by markup to what it looks like on the web<br>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-4">
           <h4><u>Details</u></h4>
            HTML Markup- An element is everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Tags help define key attributes of the element.  Tags can determine the text layout.  Including Text bold tag b;  italic tag em. <b><em>Void Tags</em></b> do not have a close tag. Tag br is a line break <b>HTML Attributes (ATTR)</b> Always a value <b>Anchor</b> tag a includes: attribute; value; content; closing tag. tag img is images to be embedded. tag p paragraph <b>Inline vs. Block</b> Block has a height and width and can be managed with variations/distinctions around the text. Inludes tag p Inline impacts the normal line items. Word within a sentence."nothing fancy".<br>
            - Inline Includes tags b, em, img, a, span, strong<br>
            - Block includes tags div, p, for
            <b>span vs. div</b> span works with inline portion of a document. div works with few paragraphs or images with captions
          </div>
         <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-5">
            <h4><u>Note to self</u></h4>
            - Syntax is critical to talk to a computer. Dumb computers requires humans to tell it precisely what to do with clear code!<br>
            - When in doubt look it up!<br><br>

          <h2 id="lesson-2">Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-1">
            <h4><u>Conceptualizing</u></h4>
           <p>Websites are like a house. HTML is the structure. CSS is the Style.  Javascript is the Interactive Components</p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-2">
            <h4><u>Tree</u></h4>
            <p>Tree structure helps structure a website.  HTML and CSS are Languages and language has Syntax and Rules to follow <br>
            HTML controls the structure and CSS controls the "style".  The Browser turns tags into Elements and the <b><em>DOM (Document Object Model)</em></b><br>
            organizes the content into a organized tree structure</p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-3">
           <h4><u>Attributes</u></h4>
           <p>Using a tage attribute and value such as tag h1 Class = "Article" reflects each time a h1 tag is used where a attribute
            equals "Article" value then you can use CSS to change the coloring to <span style="color:blue">blue</span> for example.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-4">
            <h4><u>Blocks</u></h4>
            <p>I learned how to Boxify! To use paper and pencel or software to group images, text, etc into Boxes <br> around elements. Even Border Raius
            If you can group property changes circles to squars. To group items into boxes then you can move elements around for great visuals
              and set a website to target your readers. Idea is to work Big to Small</p>
          </div>  
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-5">
            <h4><u>Text Editors</u></h4>
            <p>Installed Sublime Text 2 <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublimetext.com</a>. Text editors such as scratch.io, Codepen.io and Sublimetext 2 variations of ease for 
            use.  Sublime may help generate text to complete syntax for example.

        <div class="lesson">
          <h2 id="lesson-3">Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2> 
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-1">
            <h4><u>CSS Definition and concept</u></h4>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with structure based on boxes, CSS helps focus on style and appearance.  Seperation of HTML and CSS help seperate the formatting from the HTML coding.  Cascading allows for replication within the coding to make a change in one location but touch multiple areas.   This allows coders to avoid mistakes by typing code multiple times. In a manner of Cascading styles, CSS goes down and down into the code cascading (like National->state->municipal->home laws) until the best rule for an element  gets applied. Cascade also can be referenced as <b><em>inheritance</em></b>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-2">
            <h4><u>Repetition</u></h4>
            <p>Avoiding repetition is important.  Failing to avoid repetition leads to adding code in various places with little differences.  This may lead to errors which takes considerable amount of time to research.  If a coder decides to make changes having <b>Consistency</b> is key.  <b>Consistency</b> is the concept to keep details looking the same.  To keep code the same, an example is to assign a tag div the same class and then specify the style for that class allowing coders to make a single line change that impacts an entire class association throughout the code.  One line changes multiple areas.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-3">
          <h4><u>Selectors</u></h4>
          <p>Selectors in CSS defines which particular element ion a page a particular style will be applied to.  To define specific elements to apply style
            select elements by <b><em>Class</em></b>.  This allows CSS to (example: .desription { attribute: color; }.  Within the HTML the tag div that has a 
            <b>Class</b> of desciption can be turned red (attribute : red;). CSS has a lot of functionality.  Use %based or hex code for colors.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-4">
          <h4><u>Box Model</u></h4>
          <p>Box Model consist of Margins, border, padding and content. Contents is the nucleus surrounding by the other components. WOrking wiht Box Model
            helps structure the boxes for good appearance and makes a "Clean" Website.  Key use box-sixing: border-box; helps standardize and no thave to 
            recalculate boxes each time. Browser may be different to use webkit, mox, ms for box sizing. <b><em>Class { Display: Flex; } will help
            change display of parent container.</em></b>"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-5">
          <h4><u>Images</u></h4>
          <p>Store Images where the HTML page can access.  Image name not to include spaces or accented characters Big to Small</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-6">
              <h4><u>Code Test Refine</u></h4>
          <p>Code Test Refine.  When getting a Design Mock, code the need, test for accuracy and modify or changes as needed.  Starting with structure
          and working down into the details to get the design correct. Use Dev tools (Elements/style) for <em>on the fly</em> changes before coding into
          HTML or CSS.</p>

          <h2 id="lesson-4">Telling Computers what to do</h2> 
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-1">
            <h4><u>Computers and Programs</u></h4>
            <p>Computers as a physical entity are like bricks.  Less functionality than a toaster.  It isn't until we add programs to a computers that we realize we can set a computer to ultimately do any computation and instructions to have computer do anything we want.  This is powerful.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-2">
            <h4><u>Computer Program</u></h4>
            <p>Programs are required to tell a computer what to do.  Programs need to be a preciese series of steps to tell a computer to do what we want. Computers can handle the work of billioins of instructions per second.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-3">
            <h4><u>Programming Languages</u></h4>
            <p>Programs tell computers what to do. Programming Languages are used over natural language to be precise.  Programming language avoid ambiguity (interpret several different ways) and verbosity (too much detail) Backus (1924-2007) designed Fortran.  Admiral Grace Hopper (Colbalt).

          <div class="concept" id="lesson-4-4">
            <h4><u>Python</u></h4>
            <p>Python is a programming Language that runs on an interpreter which executes on the computer the instructurs the computer can understand.  Python has <b>Grammer</b> to follow.  <em>Python Grammer for Arithmetic Expression</em> uses a rule to follow non-terminal -> replacement method.  This form of drilling down an down to replacement until return with a terminal.  This allows for structured rules that makes Python stricter than natural language but simple and precise.

            <h4><u>Python Expressions</u></h4>
            <p>Expressions are part of a statement that has value.  Approprite grammer must be used.  Expression operator expression.  Exmaples of expressions are 0,1,2...  Operators *,+ example.  So if we use appropriate grammer we can set expression Operator Expression to equal print 1*1; print 2 +1.

          <h2 id="lesson-5">Lesson 3 Input Function Output</h2> 
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-5-1">
            <h4><u>Functions</u></h4>
            <p>Functions are called procedure in Python. Producures us inputs sometimes called operands or arguments.  Functions are useful as they perform only one thing. You can call a function and take an operand or argument and pass in to a function/procedure. Such as find you pass in inputs find('au', 3) for example is inputs.  page.find('au' 3) page is an input to the find as well.  
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-5-2">
            <h4><u>Return statement</u></h4>
            <p>The return key will evaluate against the procedure and  thereturn statement will evaluate the body of the procdure and return the value (output).  Without return, nothing will be produced in a procedure.  Output will show none. Mapping inputs to outputs.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-5-3">
            <h4><u>Making and using functions</u></h4>
            <p>Making a function is the shell being.  The function uses parameters to pull in values when the function is called.  Making a function is Function, parameter, variable, string and how each work together.  
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-5-4">
            <h4><u>Avoiding Repetition</u></h4>
            <p>Making a function is a way to continue to call on the function to perform a specific task over and over. Fnctions can be used within the program or universally in any program to be call upon to do a task.
            </p>

            <h4><u>Making Decisions</u></h4>
            <p>Using operators to compare numbers or strings using epxresssion such as boolean espressions helps build code.  Equals (=) sign to test numbers and double equals == or assignments to help test true or false against the value. We can construct a <b><em>Desicion Making Tree</em></b> to help <u>Think Procedurally</u> which helsp build code.

            <h4><u>If Else Statement</u></h4>
            <p>The if statement has a test expression; block and a value to keep track of loop interations.  i = value.  <em>If</em> statements test/evaluates the variable against the test value and if true returns a value <em>returns a different value</em>. This is a one time test/evaluation and code stops.<br>
              At this point with Comparisons, procedures, arithmatic and the if statement we can write every possible program with what we know./p>

            <h4><u>While Loop</u></h4>
            <p>Unlike IF Else statements that test values for true or false and return an output, a loop such as the While loop will test/compare against a value and will continue to loop infinitely until a conditions is met.<br>
            <em><u>Example:</em></u><br>
              def print_numbers(n):<br>

            <p>Debugging code is a must have for all programmers at all levels.  Bugs are inevitable.  You can't prevent a bug!  You have to develop a strategy to handle bugs.  There is base data the compiler will provide to help against a bug such as:  Line, function and 'How' it got there.  To strategize against a bug:  Use a search engine to research for help to remove the bug.  Use <b> Print</b> statement to follow the code to help identify what is going wrong.  Always keep code and don't discard.  It may help if you reach out to know history and things you've tried.  Going forward if you increase the # of bugs this helps get back to a state with less bugs. Copy example models how how the code should work.  If the test code works then apply your code on top for desire output.

          <h2 id="lesson-9">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2> 
          <div class="concept" id="lesson-9-1">
            <h4><u>Understanding Object Oriented Programming</u></h4>
            <p>Object Oriented programming is a style of programming used to build the structure and elements of a computer program.  With modules such as Turtle, we can build designs by setting classes as a blue print and allow for instances to be moved visually.  With speed a drawing can be established or writing visually with Object oriented  programming.<br>
            With Python a programmer can use classes to set standards for what is being called.  Classes are like a Blue Print.  With a blue print the standard form is established and we can conform to applying the same blue print across multiple instances/objects of that form.  Each object is an instance and associated with an object class.  We call procedures or methods to perform the activity.  Example is if we used a Windo as a object and we had methods open and close. One of the capabilities of a mthod is the use of <b><u>Method Overriding</b></u>. Method overriding allows for subclasses redefining the implementation of it's superclasses.  Setting up an example within the class area would set a method override that would call findarea to help calculate the area based on if a variable within subclass is a rectable, circle or triagle.<br>
            As we used in the Video webpage, we kept a general class but we set with the def __init__ we could create new memory in space for multiple instances that would look and build to the same class.  This way we can construct different movies (Instances/object) that would appear unified and could be called to the same class.  But with less  programming which is helpful to the programmer, recalling the blue print (class) is key for repeatability.  The programmer can build an within a class a instance/object.  
            <br>Object  Oriented programming allows for objects to be containted in attributes and the code in the form of procedures can be called.  Object oriented programming allows for objects to interact with one another.  Much like we did in building the "flowers", we could have Object oriented  programming call a class and using Turtle we could interact with the object to perform the same functions and with interaction capability we can turn and rotate the object then call a class to perform the function over and over.  
            </p>
            <p>Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class.  An example could be expalained based on my entering Udacity. I might be considered an instance of the class ATT_Employee.  I too could be a instance of the Class Udacity Student.  In programming I could reference details specific to me as an ATT_Employee but also relate to the Class Udacity_Student</p>

            <h4><u>Python Standard Library</u></h4>
            <p>Pythons has a library of many different types of modules.  An example of a module is Webbrowser, time, OS.  With Webbrowser, we can use def open function to open a webpage.  In module time, we can reference functions such as def sleep or def ctime for current time. <br> Take OS for example, OS has within it many types of functions that can be called.  An example is def list dir which allows us to list all of the files of a given directory. I found Python uses similar functions such as os.chrdir or os.getcwd that UNIX uses.</p>

            <h4><u>Relating Object Oriented Programming</u></h4>
            <p>As we have demonstrated in the building of our HTML and CSS files, we have referenced in the .html files a class.  Within the CSS files we have set up classes to be used as a blue print.  For each time we reference the specific class, excample Concept in our HTML file, as we call the .concept class in the CSS file, anything defined under the class concept we will give it a specific look, background color, padding, margin, border-radius.  Then we can set instances/objects to lay within the .concept class.  This makes Object Oriented programming relavent to call only .concept which sets the "blue print" for each .concept called.  This helps tremendously in programming to improve speed by allowing for repeatability and to reduce bugs.

            <h4><u>Inheritance</u></h4>
            <p>One topic that I found relevent to help programmers is the idea of inheritance.  To arrange the hierarchy that represents the "is-a-type-of" relationship.  To allow for all data and methods avaialble to the parent class to also appear in teh child calsss within the same names. This allows for the easy re-use of the same  procedures and data definitions to mirror the relationship in a intuitive way.  Such as the Billy Cyrus to Mily Cyrus example, we can pass to the Child the last_name for example.<br>
            </p> 
            <p> In the below example, I am using an Child/Parent Inheritance and while I can seek to have the CHild inherint the parent attributes, I have set up a <b><u>subclass</u></b> that will over ride the parent attributes.  In this case I should get a parent with the last name of WIlliford and with brown eyes, while the Child will get last name of Williford, eyes are blue and 100000 toys.  To build a subclass to override the parent class is called <b>Method Override</b>
            <p>
          class Parent():<br>
            def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color):<br>
          print("Parent Constructor Called")<br>

          print("Eye Color - "+self.eye_color)<br><br>
        

          class Child(Parent):<br>
          def __init__(self, last_name,eye_color, number_of_toys):<br>
          print("Child Constructor Called")<br>
          Parent.__init__(self, last_name, eye_color)<br>
          self.number_of_toys = number_of_toys<br><br>

            <h4><u>OOP Scalability</u></h4>
            <p>Object Oriented programming is a comprehensive language that is modeled around objets. Defining what an object is and how to manipulate objects is an excercise known as data modeling. Once an object is characterizced it can be associated as a class of objects. Such as the Salmon "is a" Fish scenario in which the attributes of Fish can be associated to salmon or vice versa.  Once the objects are defined based on the kind of data it contains then a programmer can manipulate the data by using methods or procedures.  These methods can be called upon and re-used in multple objects.<br>
            Because OOP is modular and allows for the seperation of functions to be called upon within a class, objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviours.  The reusability of of objects into different objects allows for improved productivity for a programmer to manipulate methods or add attributes that can propogate to the objects quickly and in large scale preventing the opportunities for mistakes.<br>
            With the ability to reuse libraries that have been established within the Python Standard Library, for example, allows for quick access to code(procedures) that allows for faster code development. It is with the modules that programmers can pull code from a standard library by which code has been established and tested extensively.  What helps a coder is the ability to associate objects to classes and be able to make changes quicker and allows for a standard for making changes in a simplier manner.  THis allows coders to spend more time verifying the code which leads to less mistakes and higher quality of software on a grander scale.<br>
            The benefits reusability, proven modules and the extensive nature of OOP to builds out attributes allows OOP to go beyond the traditional programming modules build around logical procedures that tkess in data, processes it, and produces output data. OOP is a more powerful and simplier model for the more complex and larger scale programs.<div>
